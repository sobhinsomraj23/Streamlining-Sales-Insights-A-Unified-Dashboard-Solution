The company, a supplier of computer hardware and peripherals with a head office in Delhi and regional offices across India, is facing challenges in effectively tracking and analyzing sales data due to the dynamically growing market. The current process involves regional managers from North, South, and Central India providing sales insights through numerous Excel files, leading to confusion and inefficiency. The lack of a centralized and streamlined system hinders the sales director's ability to access clear, actionable insights, complicating decision-making and strategic planning. There is a need for a customized dashboard that consolidates sales data, simplifies reporting, and enhances communication between regional managers and the sales director, facilitating data-driven decision-making and improving overall business operations.
